# Intro

This is a pulse generator for Korg Volcas. We deploy it on Raspberry Pi with USB-audio jacks. Each audio jack will produce square wave pulses very similar to the ones generated by Korg Volcas audio outputs that are labeled "sync-out".

This setup gives better control over the clock sync than the chaining method provided with Korg Volcas.

# Hardware

I tried Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and Raspberry Pi 4 but it didn't work out. They can only handle 1 or 2 USB Audio cards. That's why I decided to go with overclocked Jetson Nano.
