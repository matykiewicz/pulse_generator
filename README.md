This is a pulse generator for Korg Volcas. We deploy it on Raspberry Pi with USB-audio jacks. Each audio jack will produce square wave pulses very similar to the ones generated by Korg Volcas audio outputs that are labeled "sync-out".

This setup gives better control over the clock sync than the chaining method provided with Korg Volcas.
